# Git Punch … ouch!!!

> Using Bash (windows) or terminal (mac) or linux perform the following actions:

- Create a Folder named outter_folder
- Inside the outer folder, create another folder named inner_folder
- While still in the command line, Navigate back to the outter_folder.
- Inside the outter_folder, create a file named fullname.txt
- Edit the file using V.I by adding your First and LastName inside the file
- Save the file and exit V.I
- Create another file but this time inside the inner_folder and name it blank_file.txt
- Copy all the contents inside the fullname.txt into the blank_file.txt
- Retrieve and print out all the contents that are now inside the blank_file.txt to the terminal
- Inside the outter_folder, create one more file named ignoreme.txt

> To ensure we do not lose all of our work:
 - Lets go ahead and make it a git repository
 - Make sure that you do push the ignoreme.txt file to github.com
 - When ready, push your local repo to github.com

> Now one more thing: 
- Let’s add a README file to this project
- Inside the readme file, add one of your favorite quotes. 
- Make sure that your github.com is updated and reflects the quote

> Finally:
- Create a new branch named bug_fix
- Create an index.html file under this branch
- Inside the html file, add the following a link to a youtube video of your choice (PG)
 - Merge your branch, push your code and send me the link to your github repo via slack

### Great Job. Do not forget to DM your github repo for evaluation. Thanks
